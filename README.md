# Python Practice Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space is dedicated to practicing and showcasing simple Python projects inspired by the exercises and challenges found on Teodor Trotea's website.

# About

Teodor Trotea's website offers an array of programming exercises aimed at improving coding skills and problem-solving techniques. Here, I attempt these challenges, providing my implementations and solutions while learning and refining my Python programming skills. Each project represents a hands-on approach to tackling real-world coding problems, from beginner to intermediate levels.

# Projects Included

This repository is organized into folders, each containing a Python project based on a specific exercise or topic from the website. Here are some examples of what you might find:
